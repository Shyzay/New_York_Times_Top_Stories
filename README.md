# New York Times Top Stories

**As E Dey Hot** is an application that displays the 5 most popular articles (most viewed over the last 3 hours) from the New York Times nytimes.com website.

It will have **the title of the article, a link to the article, the byline, and the published date**.

It will be able to cache data fetched from the external API into a local database, also render data from its database if it is not older than 5 mins, but If the data is older than 5 mins, it will refetch it from the API and update the cache with the new data.
