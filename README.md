# New York Times Top Stories

**As E Dey Hot** is an application that displays the 5 most popular articles (most viewed over the last 3 hours) from the New York Times nytimes.com website.

It will have **the title of the article, a link to the article, the byline, and the published date**.

It will be able to cache data fetched from the external API into a local database, also render data from its database if it is not older than 5 mins, but If the data is older than 5 mins, it will refetch it from the API and update the cache with the new data.

This application will be developed with these technologies 


* **Flask**
* **Python**
* **HTML and CSS**
* **Javascript**
* **Test Driven Development**
* **Travis CI**
* **Virtual Environment**

The Database will be designed with **MongoDB**.

## How to Run The hello.py file



* Copy or clone the file to your local system
* Open in your favourite Editor or IDE, for me I used **Pyscripter**

In this file we are importing the flask library in the first line. If you do not have that library installed, you will get an error.


*So this is what to do.*

* Install flask, by simply typing `pip install flask` in your command line and hit **enter** button. Once you are pretty sure flask is installed, 
* Simply run the **hello.py** script. You can run this by typing `python hello.py` on your command line, followed by the **enter** button
* Once you run the script, your website should now be live on your local machine and can be viewed by typing `localhost:5000` in your browser and send it.

**Boom!** There you go.

Can you see the **Hello World**? If you can, 

:clap::clap::clap: **Congratulations** you just lauched a website.
