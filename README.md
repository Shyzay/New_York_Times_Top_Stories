# New York Times Top Stories

This application will display the 5 most popular articles (most viewed over the last 3 hours) from the New York Times nytimes.com website.

It will have the title of the article, a link to the article, the byline, and the published date.

It will be able to cache data fetched from the external API into a local database, also render data from its database if it is not older than 5 mins, but If the data is older than 5 mins, it will refetch it from the API and update the cache with the new data.

This application will be developed with these technologies 

1. Flask
2. Python
3. HTML and CSS
4. Javascript
5. Test Driven Development
6. Travis CI
7. Virtual Environment

The Database will be designed with MongoDB.
